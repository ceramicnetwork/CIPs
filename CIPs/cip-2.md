## Simple Summary
<!--Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the CIP.-->
This proposes Discord as a platform for fast-paced conversations about the Ceramic network.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
The Ceramic community needs a place where people can join to discuss things related to Ceramic.

## Motivation
<!--Motivation is critical for CIPs that want to change the Ceramic protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the CIP solves. CIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
As an open source, decentralized protocol, it is important for Ceramic to have an open forum for community engagement. Discord provides a nice way to do that and is something many members of the web3 community are familiar with using. Unlike Slack, Discord has a nice identity model that doesn't require users creating new identities/logins for each community they join.

## Implementation
