<!--[title]: Give your issue a concise, descriptive title prefixed by either its *type* for standards CIPs or its category for other CIPs. (i.e. Core: Protocol Upgrade, Meta: Define CIP Process, etc.).-->

<!--[category]: Here is a description of category terms.
- `Core`: an CIP that affects the core protocol.
- `Networking`: an CIP thst affects the networking layer (i.e. libp2p or syncing).
- `Interface`: an CIP that affects the Ceramic API or provider interface.
- `RFC`: an CIP that proposes an implementation standard (i.e. doctypes, document configurations, or document schemas).
- `Meta`: an CIP that affects the governance process for CIPs.-->

## Simple Summary
Tightens the time bounds for Data Events


## Abstract
This CIP adds the ability to more closely determine the time _after_ which a Data Event was added to a Ceramic stream.
Currently, it is possible to accurately determine the time _before_ which a Data event was added by looking at the Time
Event corresponding to the Data Event. However, it is not possible to say with any degree of accuracy how far in the
past the event was created.


## Motivation
Certain use cases cannot be efficiently implemented without the notion of both a lower time bound (i.e. a "happened
after" time) and an upper time bound (i.e. a "happened before" time) for when a particular Data Event occurs.

For example:
1. A Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) Ceramic stream requires the ability to determine which Data Event occurred _last_. An
   "after" time enables a Ceramic node to better determine the authoritative order in which events occurred.
2. Transactional streams require the ability to strictly order Data Events across multiple streams. An "after" time
   enables the partial ordering of events across streams, which in turn enables future stream types to enforce ordering
   between streams.


## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.-->
Specification goes here.


## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
Rationale goes here.


## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All CIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. CIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility section may be rejected outright.-->
Backwards compatibility goes here.


## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any CIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted.-->
Implementation goes here.


## Security Considerations
<!--All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
