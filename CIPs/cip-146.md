## Simple Summary
Allows Data Events to prove that they happened after an Ethereum block timestamp

## Abstract
This CIP adds the ability to more closely determine the time _after_ which a Data Event was added to a Ceramic stream.
Currently, it is possible to accurately determine the time _before_ which a Data event was added by looking at the Time
Event corresponding to the Data Event. However, it is not possible to say with any degree of accuracy how far in the
past the event was created.

## Motivation
Certain use cases cannot be efficiently implemented without the notion of both a lower time bound (i.e. a "happened
after" time) and an upper time bound (i.e. a "happened before" time) for when a particular Data Event occurs.

For example:
1. A Last-Writer-Wins (LWW) Ceramic stream requires the ability to determine which Data Event occurred _last_. An
   "after" time enables a Ceramic node to better determine the authoritative order in which events occurred.
2. Transactional streams require the ability to strictly order Data Events across multiple streams. An "after" time
   enables the partial ordering of events across streams, which in turn enables future stream types to enforce ordering
   between streams.

## Specification

### Three Flavors of Time Proofs

#### Before

This proves that Data Events in the corresponding Merkle tree happened before Ethereum blocks.

```json
{
  "chainId": "eip155:1",
  "root": {
    "/": "bafyreicbwzaiyg2l4uaw6zjds3xupqeyfq3nlb36xodusgn24ou3qvgy4e"
  },
  "txHash": {
    "/": "bagjqcgzax554ofnatxvdc54gnlcpykkkzgaa5yvutye4kx2wa6cxtp536fma"
  },
  "txType": "f(bytes32)"
}
```

#### After

This proves that Data Events happened after Ethereum blocks.

```json
{
  "chainId": "eip155:1",
  "blkHash": {
    "/": "bagiacgzapa6nljx6xyj5bcwa2wp2pztgja6v4r3fikzjncfg6c7mhuk75pka"
  },
  "blkNumber": 17167183,
  "blkTimestamp": 0
}
```

#### Ordered

This proves both that Data Events in the corresponding Merkle tree happened before this Ethereum block, and that Data
Events that have the CID of this proof in either their `after` or `prev` field happened after this Ethereum block.
 
```json
{
  "chainId": "eip155:1",
  "root": {
    "/": "bafyreicbwzaiyg2l4uaw6zjds3xupqeyfq3nlb36xodusgn24ou3qvgy4e"
  },
  "txHash": {
    "/": "bagjqcgzax554ofnatxvdc54gnlcpykkkzgaa5yvutye4kx2wa6cxtp536fma"
  },
   "blkHash": {
     "/": "bagiacgzapa6nljx6xyj5bcwa2wp2pztgja6v4r3fikzjncfg6c7mhuk75pka"
   },
  "txType": "f(bytes32)"
}
```

### After in Data Event

The `header` field of a Data Event can include a new `after` field that points to either an After-Proof or an
Ordered-Proof.

```json
{
    "data": {},
    "header": {
        "controllers": [
            "did:key:z6MkhvoSQhPDNwotybwX9o2scoSvkx5Syem3GiM9FV8h5YXG"
        ],
       "after": {
          "/": "bafyreidtsz24vstukaoxisgrpdjijgsof3u3ls5d22fcly2qcp6ksx4cfe"
       }
    }
}
```

### After in Time Event

The `proof` field of a Time Event can point to either a Before-Proof or an Ordered-Proof.

```json
{
  "id": {
    "/": "bagcqceraplay4erv6l32qrki522uhiz7rf46xccwniw7ypmvs3cvu2b3oulq"
  },
  "path": "0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0",
  "prev": {
    "/": "bagcqceraplay4erv6l32qrki522uhiz7rf46xccwniw7ypmvs3cvu2b3oulq"
  },
  "proof": {
    "/": "bafyreidtsz24vstukaoxisgrpdjijgsof3u3ls5d22fcly2qcp6ksx4cfe"
  }
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility


## Implementation


## Security Considerations
<!--All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
