## Simple Summary
<!--Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the CIP.-->
An API for reading and writing events on Ceramic event streams.


## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
This CIP introduces a REST API that can be used to subscribe to a number of streams inside of an interest range, and write new events to these streams. The API exposes two main ways of retrieving events. A simple method that uses the nodes local ordering of events to retrieve events by simply keeping track of a single vector client side. More advanced users can use a simplified version of the [Recon](https://cips.ceramic.network/CIPs/cip-124) protocol to retrieve events in their logical order.


## Motivation
<!--Motivation is critical for CIPs that want to change the Ceramic protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the CIP solves. CIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
In order to enable services and databases other than ComposeDB to be built on top of Ceramic, an API to read and write directly on event streams is needed. This also enables developers to get direct access to the event streams underlaying ComposeDB.


## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.-->

This specification introduces a REST API for interacting directly with event streams on a node.



### GET `/ceramic/subscribe/{streamid}`

This endpoint is called to subscribe to new events in a given interest range. This endpoint uses the node’s local ordering of events within the given range, constructed in the order in which the node received the events. If you want the global ordering of events you can use the *recon* endpoint. 

The range is normally defined as `ceramic://*?<sort-key>=<sort-value>`, where *sort-key* describes a field in the header of the InitEvent of a stream, and *sort-value* is the value of this field. For example to subscribe to all MIDs of a particular Model you can use `ceramic://*?model=kjzl6hvfrbw6c82mkud4qs38zl4hd03ifoyg2ksvfjkhuxebfzh3ef89vwvtvrr`.

This endpoint will respond as soon as the node knows about new events, given the *eventOffset*, or when *duration* amount of seconds has passed.

#### Example:

```
/ceramic/subscribe/*?model=kjzl6hvfrbw6c82mkud4qs38zl4hd03ifoyg2ksvfjkhuxebfzh3ef89vwvtvrr&ctrlRangeStart=0x0000000000000000&ctrlRangeEnd=0xffffffffffffffff&eventOffset=123&duration=1000
```

#### Parameters:

* *streamid* <string> - the stream to subscribe to (Normally `*` is used to subscribe to sets of streams)

* *{sort-key}* <string> - the *sort-key* and *sort-value* to subscribe to (e.g. `model` and `kjzl6hvfrbw6c82mkud4qs38zl4hd03ifoyg2ksvfjkhuxebfzh3ef89vwvtvrr` respectively)
* *ctrlRangeStart* <string> - hex encoded string describing the start of the range of controllers to sync (defaults to `0x0000000000000000`)
* *ctrlRangeEnd* <string> - hex encoded string describing the end of the range of controllers to sync (defaults to `0xffffffffffffffff`)
* *eventOffset* <integer> - the number of events already consumed
* *duration* <integer> - the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a response

#### Returns:

There are two different content types supported as return value, as specified by the [`Accept`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept) http header.

**JSON:**

Content-Type:  `application/json`

This content type returns a json representation of the events received. Note that this is just a representation of the event content, full verifiability is not retained.

- *events* <array<object>> - the list of events
  - *eventId* <string> - the id of the event
  - *id* <string> - CID of the InitEvent for this stream
  - *prev* <array<string>> - CIDs of previous hash linked events
  - *header* <object> - header for the event
  - *data* <object> - the data of the event
  - *timestamp* <integer> - the unixtime this event was timestamped (if it has been)
- *eventOffset* <integer> - the number of events consumed



**CAR file:**

Content-Type:  `application/vnd.ipld.car`

This content types returns the underlaying IPLD data structure of the event streams encoded as a CAR file. This data can be used to trustlessly verify the integrity of the event stream. 

The root object of the CAR file is a *SubscriptionResult* which contains an array of *EvenIds* the new *eventOffset*. The CAR file also includes all *Event* objects, corresponding to the eventids in the subscription result.

It's worth noting that an *EventId* always includes the CID of its *Event*.

```verilog
// https://developers.ceramic.network/protocol/streams/event-log/#data-event
type Event InitEvent | DataEvent | TimeEvent

// https://cips.ceramic.network/CIPs/cip-124#eventids
type EventId Bytes // sort-data + Event CID

type SubscriptionResult {
  events [EventId]
	eventOffset Integer
}
```

### GET `/ceramic/recon/{key*}`

Interact with the node using the Recon protocol directly. This allows you to have greater control over the data you consume, but you have to be able to run the Recon algorithm client side.

#### Example:

```
/ceramic/recon/kjzl6hvfrbw6c82mkud4qs38zl4hd03ifoyg2ksvfjkhuxebfzh3ef89vwvtvrr,kjzl6hvfrbw6c82mkud4qs38zl4hd03ifoyg2ksvfjkhuxebfzh3ef89vwvtvrr,kjzl6hvfrbw6c82mkud4qs38zl4hd03ifoyg2ksvfjkhuxebfzh3ef89vwvtvrr&duration=1000
```

#### Parameters:

* _key*_ <Array<string>> - a comma separated list of eventids and ahashes (multicodec encoded), first and last key must be eventid, every even key must be an ahash
* *duration* <integer> - the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a response

#### Returns:

Content-Type:  `application/json`

- _key*_ <array<string>> - a list of eventids and ahashes (multicodec encoded), first and last key must be eventid, every even key must be an ahash



---

### GET `/ceramic/events/{eventid*}`

Retrieve events given an array of eventids.

#### Example:

```
/ceramic/events/kjzl6hvfrbw6c82mkud4qs38zl4hd03ifoyg2ksvfjkhuxebfzh3ef89vwvtvrr,kjzl6hvfrbw6c82mkud4qs38zl4hd03ifoyg2ksvfjkhuxebfzh3ef89vwvtvrr,kjzl6hvfrbw6c82mkud4qs38zl4hd03ifoyg2ksvfjkhuxebfzh3ef89vwvtvrr
```

#### Returns:

There are two different content types supported as return value, as specified by the [`Accept`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept) http header.

**JSON:**

Content-Type:  `application/json`

This content type returns a json representation of the events requested. Note that this is just a representation of the event content, full verifiability is not retained.

- *events* <array<object>> - the list of events
  - *eventId* <string> - the id of the event
  - *id* <string> - CID of the InitEvent for this stream
  - *prev* <array<string>> - CIDs of previous hash linked events
  - *header* <object> - header for the event
  - *data* <object> - the data of the event
  - *timestamp* <integer> - the unixtime this event was timestamped (if it has been)

**CAR file:**

Content-Type:  `application/vnd.ipld.car`

This content types returns the underlaying IPLD data structure of the event streams encoded as a CAR file. This data can be used to trustlessly verify the integrity of the event stream. 

The root object of the CAR file is *EventsResult* which is a convenience type containing an array of CIDs corresponding to the eventsids requested. The CAR file also includes all *Event* objects, including all IPLD blocks for these event, but no data from the previous events, e.g. DataEvents include signature envelope, event, and potentially detached payload, while TimeEvents include their entire merkle tree witness.

```verilog
// https://developers.ceramic.network/protocol/streams/event-log/#data-event
type Event InitEvent | DataEvent | TimeEvent

type Events [&Event]
```



---

### POST `/ceramic/events`

Adds a new event to the node.

#### Request body:

The request body must contain the complete event data.

**CAR:**

Content-Type:  `application/vnd.ipld.car`

A CAR file where the root is an *Event* as described below.

```verilog
// https://developers.ceramic.network/protocol/streams/event-log/#data-event
type Event InitEvent | DataEvent | TimeEvent
```

**JSON:**

Content-Type:  `application/json`

A possible convenience method for adding an event by only submitting a JWT.

Only possible once we’ve migrated to use *Varsig* and can create events as plain signed JWTs.

```javascript
{
  event: "<jwt>"
}
```

#### Returns:



**JSON:**

- *eventid* <string> - the eventId of this event



---

### GET `/stats/active-ranges`

A status endpoint that returns all ranges that this node is actively monitoring.

#### Returns:

* *ranges* <array<object>> - a list of all subscriptions
  * *reconRange* <Array<string>> - a Recon message, *`[eventid or ahash]`*
  * *eventOffset* <integer> - the total number of events observed in this range




## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

The choice of using a REST API enables ease of integration and content types to more easily send and respond using binary formats such as CAR files. It's also a common pattern to have service workers serve http requests opening up for future browser native implementations of the Ceramic protocol.

There are two main ways of polling for new events. Using recon and a more simple poll. This enables advanced developers to get full control with recon, while a simple poll API based on a single event counter is much easier to use for most developers. The disadvantage of the latter is that events will be received in the order that the node received them, not in the global order of the network.


## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All CIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. CIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility section may be rejected outright.-->
The Ceramic API provides a new way of interacting with event streams. The main backwards compatibility consideration is that the ComposeDB implementation in js-ceramic would need to be refactored, but this should not imply any major breaking changes.


## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any CIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted.-->
No implementation yet. Planned in [rust-ceramic](https://github.com/3box/rust-ceramic/)


## Security Considerations
<!--All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
Currently this API is not designed to be exposed to the public internet. Instead it's intended for internal use, e.g. consumed by a ComposeDB node that in turn has a  more strict access controlled API open to the internet.
