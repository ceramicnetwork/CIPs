## Simple Summary
Adding the ability to merge divergent branches of a Ceramic stream.


## Abstract
This CIP adds the ability to merge divergent branches of a stream. It describes a modification to the `prev` field for a
Ceramic event so that it can be either a single CID or a list of CIDs.

For a `prev` that is a list of CIDs, the aggregator may treat these CIDs differently depending on the order. How this
order is interpreted is an implementation detail outside the scope of this spec.


## Motivation
A Ceramic stream can fork if two different events both have the same CID in their `prev` field. This can happen for
various legitimate reasons.

For example:
1. One or more Time Events corresponding to prior Data Events are received at the same time as new Data Events appear
   with their `prev` pointing to a prior Data Event. Such Time Events are new stream heads.
2. Two or more Ceramic nodes are generating Data Events to the same Ceramic stream.

### Definitions
* A "join" `A ⋁ B` find the common ancestor of the events `A` and `B`.
    * We call a join point a "fork".
* A "meet" `A ⋀ B` find the common descendent of the events `A` and `B`.
    * We call a meet point a "merge".
* An event A is "covered" if another event B the A's CID in its `prev` field.
* An event A is "uncovered" if there is no event with A's CID in its `prev` field.
* A "diverged" stream has more than one uncovered event.
* A "converged" stream has a single uncovered event.

### Example
![lattice](../assets/cip-145/lattice.png)
Fig. 1: A lattice where 1, 2, 3 are Data Events that got anchored and A, B are events on a pruned branch. 2 and A both
have `prev: 1's CID` creating a branch. 3 has a multi-prev `prev: [2's CID, B's CID]` converging the pruned branch back
into the stream. 

When a stream forks, Ceramic uses a set of rules to determine which of the multiple uncovered heads will serve as the
tip of the stream. If a pruned branch contains Data Events then that data would be lost. In order to fix this, we enable
an event to specify multiple ancestor events in its `prev` field so that a single event can cover multiple uncovered
events.

Using multi-prev Data Events allows us to reduce the number of uncovered events and call any stream where there is only a
single uncovered converged state. Any stream where there are data events without a common descendent are in a diverged
state. The streams converged/diverged state can be determined just by looking at the `prev` field of the event headers
of the events for that stream.

TODO: Aaron to add more diagrams



The other uncovered events are on dead branches. If a pruned branch contains only time events and no
data events it can be safely ignored.

- liveness
- soundness (ancestor init, tip as descendant == converged, no dead events)
- retain history


API: 
- give me just the nodes needed to get the current state

## Specification

Branch pruning rules:
1. If a stream is in a diverged state, we only consider branches that contain uncovered Data Events.
2. For branches that container uncovered Data Events, we only consider the first Data Event on a branch after the fork.
3. The Data Event that is covered by the earliest Time Event wins. 
4. If two uncovered Data Events are covered by Time Events at the same block height, the Data Event with the lower CID
   wins.


## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
Rationale goes here.


## Backwards Compatibility
All events that have a string in `prev` instead of a list will work with this CIP.
Nodes that implement have this CIP will not understand what new events with a `prev` list means.

This branch pruning rules specified in this document supersede the behavior of the protocol described in CIPnnn even for
streams that just have a single `prev`.

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any CIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted.-->
Implementation goes here.

legacy `prev`
```json
{ "prev": "CID1"}
```

multi-priv `priv`
```json
{ "prev": ["CID1", "CID2", "CID3"] }
```


## Security Considerations
<!--All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
